I created this repository to store my beginner python projects which are developed in google colab and visual studio as well. Beginner projects are done by python libraries like numpy, pandas and seaborn etc. and also the algorithms like knn, random forest, regression and classifications.

PROJECT 1 : ABALONE AGE PREDICTION
Focused on analyzing data related to abalone shells. The specific goal is likely to determine the age of individual abalone shells based on various factors or measurements derived from the shells.
The data analysis might involve:
==> Collecting data: Gathering information about abalone shells, such as their length, diameter, height, and other physical characteristics.
==> Applying statistical techniques: Using statistical methods to analyze the collected data and identify patterns or relationships between the physical characteristics and the age of the shells.
==> Developing a model: Creating a predictive model that can estimate the age of an abalone shell based on its measured characteristics.
'''''The ultimate goal of this analysis could be to improve understanding of abalone growth and development, aiding in fisheries management or scientific research.''''

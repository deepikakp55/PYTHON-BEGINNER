PROJECT 1 : ABALONE AGE PREDICTION

The ultimate goal of this analysis could be to improve understanding of abalone growth and development, aiding in fisheries management or scientific research.
Focused on analyzing data related to abalone shells. The specific goal is likely to determine the age of individual abalone shells based on various factors or measurements derived from the shells.

The data analysis might involve:

==> Collecting data: Gathering information about abalone shells, such as their length, diameter, height, and other physical characteristics.

==> Applying statistical techniques: Using statistical methods to analyze the collected data and identify patterns or relationships between the physical characteristics and the age of the shells.

==> Developing a model: Creating a predictive model that can estimate the age of an abalone shell based on its measured characteristics.

PROJECT 2 : AIR QUALITY CHECK PREDICTION

The project aims to predict air quality levels based on historical data using various regression models. 
The objective is to find the most accurate model for forecasting air pollution levels and understanding the key factors influencing air quality.

Data Handling:

==> The dataset (AirQuality.csv) is loaded and preprocessed, Missing values are identified and handled using imputation, Standardization techniques are applied to prepare the data for modeling.

Machine Learning Models Used:

==> Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Support Vector Regression (SVR)

==> Performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to evaluate these models.

Statistical Analysis:

==> Pearson correlation is used to understand relationships between variables.

Data visualization techniques (Seaborn, Matplotlib) are used to analyze trends.
